- 👋 Hi, I’m Manni Singh
- 👀 I’m interested in a Software engineering/Development opportunity
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing up my last two weeks at Central Washington University as a Senior, completing my bachelors in computer science.
- 📫 You can reach me at mannisandhu1996@gmail.com or at my daytime cell - 253-391-7896.


I have a broad skillset with coding in different languages: Java, Python and C++ are my most used languages,
while I take interest in learning more languages and adding to my skillset.

Major projects that I have worked on are -  
i) Fitness tracker - that takes your desired weight goal and calculates the amount of macros you need to intake in order to reach the desired goal in a given time.


ii) TA assigner - this takes a CSV file that assigns classes their TA's according to the graduation date, experience and the pre-requisites passed.


iii) Employee scheduler - made a python algorithm that takes a bunch of employees and makes a schedule according to the employee availabilities and restaurant needs.
